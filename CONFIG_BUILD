# These values can be used to tweak the build to facilitate development and debugging.
# CONFIG_BUILD_ENFORCING_MODE is used to put the system in permissive mode or enforcing mode after install.
# CONFIG_BUILD_REMEDIATE openscap (oscap) audits the system using SCAP content then remediates issues by 
#                                 modifying the system to resolve identified problems.  CLIP uses oscap in 
#                                 %post of the kickstart.  If this is set to "n" oscap is used to audit but
#                                 not remediate.  You can still remediate at run-time after deployment.
# CONFIG_BUILD_UNCONFINED_TOOR allows the toor user to run the unconfined (read->all powerful) toor_r:toor_t role.
#                              Normally the toor user is confined in the sysadm_r:sysadm_t role.
# CONFIG_BUILD_ENABLE_DHCP enable DHCP for all network interfaces
# CONFIG_BUILD_VPN_INCLUDE_TOOR enable toor user for vpn variant
# CONFIG_BUILD_ENABLE_SSH_6 enable OpenSSH version 6 with modern crypto and the Secure Secure Shell configuation.
# 			    This includes support for ED25519 and RSA keys and disables weak algorithms.
# 			    See here for info on the configuration: https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/secure-secure-shell.html
# Note: these variables and values will be inserted into /root/clip-info.txt for inspection at run-time.

#   Tester: "My install is busted."
#   Developer: "What version do you have installed?"
#   Tester: "I don't know.  How do I figure that out?"
#   Developer: "Run '# cat /root/clip-info.txt' and send me the output."
