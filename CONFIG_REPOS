# CLIP officially supports RHEL.  If you choose to use CentOS it will probably
# work.  There is guidance below for both.
#
# Basic instructions:
#
# This is the file where you configure yum repos.  The packages found in these
# yum repos can be referenced from the kickstart files in 
# ./kickstarts/<name>/<name>.ks.  The packages from the repos below will be 
# included in generated ISOs.
#
#
# Note that for now, these must be local repos.  We plan on adding FTP/HTTP
# support in the future.  One of the issues we are trying to wrap our heads
# around is ensuring we still version the packages used when rolling the
# builds.  To do this with FTP/HTTP we would like to wget the packages when
# rolling the ISO.  We do not want to just stick URLs into kickstarts
# because we lose the benefit of rigorously versioning the packages used.
# Anywho, we're thinking about it, but no timeline yet ;)

# It is fairly common to pull in packages from EPEL but having EPEL is not a requirement!
#epel = /mnt/repos/epel-pinned-revisions

# NOTE: If using RHEL, *not CentOS*, you must provide the Optional repo.
