Description

This document will describe how to switch from iptables to firewalld. As
with everything in CLIP, this is just the bare minimum to get things
working and to be as secure as possible. You should expect to need to make 
modifications for your needs.

===========================================================================
Why switch?

At present it is completely fine to stick with using iptables. Long term, 
iptables is going to be replaced and switching to firewalld might help
abstract away that change and make the conversion easier. 

NetworkManager can communicate with firewalld to allow the system to switch 
the security posture of the firewall based on networking.

Firewalld has built in authorization controls based on SELinux context, 
command, and UID.

Firewalld plugs into the audit framework to get verbose auditing of changes
to the firewall. 

===========================================================================
What does CLIP do? 

    We configure firewalld - Check out kickstart/includes/fix-firewalld         
    to see exactly what we do.

    Lockdown Whitelisting 
        We use this to only allow certain SELinux domains to modify the 
        firewall. This is done be turning lockdowns on in 
        /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf and by modifying
        /etc/firewalld/lockdown-whitelist.xml.

    Switch to the block zone
        This blocks all incoming packets but allows all outbound packets
        and packets sent over loopback.

    Remove rules that allow packets sent over loopback
        We add an override file for the firewalld unit that removes the 
        rules that ACCEPT all traffic over loopback. These rules are 
        hard coded into the firewalld source and cannot be removed using
        the firewalld configuration files.

    Set up a core set of direct rules
        Use SECMark to label server and client ping and SSH packets

        Allow server and client ping and SSH packets 

        Add a rule to the bottom of the OUTPUT chain in the filter table 
        to DROP outbound packets by default.

    Update the SELinux policy
        We now use labels for all D-Bus services so we label the service
        org.fedoraproject.FirewallD1 that is used by firewalld.


===========================================================================
How do you switch? 
    This _should_ be pretty painless. You can enable firewalld in all
    variants or you can enable it up per variant. At present, CLIP disables
    firewalld in all variants.

    To enable firewalld in a single variant you need to update that variants 
    kickstart file, kickstart/clip-VARIANTNAME/clip-VARIANTNAME.ks, to set the 
    environment variable CONFIG_ENABLE_FIREWALLD=y in the %post of the 
    kickstart.

    Ths must be done beloow the two lines where the build system adds in the 
    top level environment variables. An example of this is shown below.
    "
    # DO NOT REMOVE THE FOLLOWING LINE. NON-EXISTENT WARRANTY VOID IF REMOVED.
    #CONFIG-BUILD-PLACEHOLDER

    export CONFIG_ENABLE_FIREWALLD=y
    "
    
    To enable firewalld globally you need to modify the CONFIG_BUILD file
    and switch the line
    CONFIG_ENABLE_FIREWALLD := n
    to 
    CONFIG_ENABLE_FIREWALLD := y
