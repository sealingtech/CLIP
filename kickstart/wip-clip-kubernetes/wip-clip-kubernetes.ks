# FIXME: Change the username and password.
#        If a hashed password is specified it will be used
#        and the PASSWORD field will be ignored.
#
#        To generate a SHA512 hashed password try something like this:
#           python -c "import crypt; print crypt.crypt('neutronbass', '\$6\$314159265358\$')"
#        Note that the "\$6" indicates it is SHA512 and must remain in place.
#        Further, make sure you specify a salt such as "314159265358."
#        Finally, make sure the hashed password is in single quotes to prevent expansion of the dollar signs.
